description: 
---

GitHub offers Atom feeds for releases of projects hosted on the site, complete with release notes if maintainers provide them â€” a painless way to stay up to date with new releases. 

The feed for a project can be accessed at<br>`https://github.com/{org-name}/{project-name}/releases.atom`<br>so you can subscribe to releases of Leaflet.Deflate via [https://github.com/oliverroick/Leaflet.Deflate/releases.atom](https://github.com/oliverroick/Leaflet.Deflate/releases.atom).
