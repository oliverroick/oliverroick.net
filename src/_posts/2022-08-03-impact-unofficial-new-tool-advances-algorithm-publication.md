IMPACT Unofficial writing about APT (Algorithm Publication Tool), a project I have been working on since the beginning of the year:

> APT is designed to support the unique needs of scientific writing by creating a high quality user-friendly authoring tool that generates PDF and HTML versions of final documents. Further development has added more user-friendly capabilities. An ATBD author can seamlessly add complex equations using LaTeX; track ATBD versions; and automatically number and label equations, tables, and figures. Document citations are provided for all public ATBDs.
