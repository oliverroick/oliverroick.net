In case, you have been wondering what I've been up to since I joined [ExCiteS](http://ucl.ac.uk/excites) last year, here's the result: Yesterday, we [announced the release](http://geokey.org.uk/blog/2014/official-release.html) of [GeoKey](http://geokey.org.uk/) — a platform for participatory mapping.

GeoKey provides local communities with a web-based infrastructure to collect, share and discuss local knowledge. You can use it to setup your own mapping project with your community and to collect, visualise and analyse data using the tools of your choice.

Check out the [project website](http://geokey.org.uk/) or the [source code](https://github.com/ExCiteS/geokey).
