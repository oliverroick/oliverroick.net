Placemark have released a neat map-data conversation tool that transforms data between pretty much any geo-data file format. Upload files or paste text, convert and then download the converted data in no time.

From the [announcement post](https://www.placemark.io/post/introducing-our-free-map-file-converter):

> In the course of implementing  [lots and lots of file formats](https://www.placemark.io/format-matrix)  in Placemark, we’ve ended up with some great, reusable tools. I figured it’d be pretty useful to just let anyone use those things, on a convenient drag & drop (or click, or paste) page. I hope it’s useful. Happy Friday!

> This list will go out of date, but right now - you can convert:

 This is a tool you want to bookmark.
