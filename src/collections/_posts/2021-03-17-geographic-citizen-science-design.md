My former colleagues at University College London, Artemis Skarlatidou and Muki Haklay, have edited and published a new book:

> _Geographic Citizen Science Design_ takes an anthropological and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) stance to provide the theoretical and methodological foundations to support the design, development and evaluation of citizen science projects and their user-friendly applications. Through a careful selection of case studies in the urban and non-urban contexts of the Global North and South, the chapters provide insights into the design and interaction barriers, as well as on the lessons learned from the engagement of a diverse set of participants; for example, literate and non-literate people with a range of technical skills, and with different cultural backgrounds.
>
> Looking at the field through the lenses of specific case studies, the book captures the current state of the art in research and development of geographic citizen science and provides critical insight to inform technological innovation and future research in this area.

The PDF is open access and free to download. 

There's also an [online book launch event](https://uclexcites.blog/2021/03/15/geographic-citizen-science-design-no-one-left-behind-book-launch-event/) on Tuesday, 23 March 2021 at 5pm (GMT).
