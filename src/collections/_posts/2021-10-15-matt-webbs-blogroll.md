Back in the old days, many blogs had a blogroll listing links to other blogs the author follows. Blogrolls were _the_ way to discover new blogs and rediscover old ones. With the arrival of Tumblr, Medium, and Substack, which mostly replaced publishing on self-hosted and self-built websites, blogrolls disappeared almost completely. 

But there’s hope. Matt Webb’s blogroll, for once, is an absolute treasure trove. It lists more than 200 blogs, most of them with RSS feeds, including many old gems I had forgotten plus many I had not yet heard of before.
