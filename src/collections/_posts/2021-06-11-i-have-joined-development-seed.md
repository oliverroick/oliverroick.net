title: I have joined Development Seed
description: Back to making maps.
---

[I've started a new role at Development Seed](). I want to do work that matters, and what matters more than making geographic data accessible to humans? Working at Development Seed is a continuation of the journey I started as a Geography student 20 years ago and left about two years ago to try something different.

Iâ€˜m happy to be wrangling latitudes and longitudes and making maps again.
