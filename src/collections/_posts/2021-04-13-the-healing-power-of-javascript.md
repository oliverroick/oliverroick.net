This is an all-around great piece by [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com).

> You can take stewardship too far. I probably have. There is a diminishing return on what you can get out of any system, regardless of how much you put into it. But I don’t care.

> And I’m able to emerge and become human, or part human, and enter into that line-by-line world, where there is very little judgement, just you and the mechanics of the systems, systems that become increasingly beautiful the more time you spend with them. For me, this stewardship is therapy.

Some people maintain a garden, not to win a prize at a gardening show or to grow and sell the most delicious apples. They do this for themselves to look at and enjoy the slightly too sour apple every now and then. I write and maintain this website, knowing that only a tiny portion of internet citizens will ever land on these pages. 

I can spend hours working on this website's tiniest details, making things simpler, sometimes a little more complex. I would write a script to make it easier to create new posts, make the site load a little faster, or tweak the copy on the about page. Making progress on a project for the sake of progress alone — it can be therapeutic.
