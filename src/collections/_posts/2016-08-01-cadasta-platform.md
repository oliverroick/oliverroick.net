Cadasta platform was an online platform to document informal land-rights with the goal to provide formal land titles to occupants. Intended as a fit-for-purpose solution for various communities around the world, we designed the Cadasta platform based on the [Social Tenure Domain Model](https://stdm.gltn.net) enabling groups to map land, survey residents and their occupancy, and to upload supporting documents, while also providing the flexibility to add custom fields for each project to collect additional project-specific information.

The platform featured a REST API, supporting the Cadasta QGIS plugin, as well as a custom [ODK](https://getodk.org) API for mobile data collection.
