Next Tuesday, 13th May, I will be speaking at [#geomob London](http://geomobldn.org) about the story and ideas behind Community Maps 2.0, which is about to be released soon. 

The event starts at 6:30p.m. and takes place at Pearson Lecture Theatre on UCL's Bloomsbury Campus. If you want to join in, please feel free to register via the event's [Lanyrd page](https://web.archive.org/web/20140428134418/http://lanyrd.com:80/2014/geomob-may/).
