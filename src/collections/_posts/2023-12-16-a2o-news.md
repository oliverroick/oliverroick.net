[A2O Search](/news/2023/a2o-blogs.html) received coverage in major Australian news outlets.

[Sydney Morning Harald](https://www.smh.com.au/technology/google-for-wildlife-sounds-huge-boost-for-conservation-research-20231127-p5en31.html):

> “What we have built here is a search tool to liberate the data collected in the field. Instead of trying to manually sift through what amounts to hundreds of years of data that we could not live long enough to go through, AI does it for us,”

[ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-29/qut-google-australia-a2o-search-audio-search-engine-wildlife/103158632):

> Researchers hope the audio search engine will yield important insights into where some animals go after bushfires and other natural disasters, and to better understand the impact of climate change and the spread of invasive species.
