Sascha Collet:

> Winds circulate around the globe, forming patterns of gigantic proportions. These patterns become part of human culture and are reflected in our architecture. They are hidden designs, mapping the complexion of the earth, which we can uncover. By orienting on the direction of general winds, airports recreate wind patterns, forming a representation of a global wind map with steel and stone, thus making the invisible visible.

The predominant westerlies in central Europe, even local winds like the [Mistral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_(wind)) along the Rhone valley in southern France or the [Sirocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirocco) in northern Africa and southern Europe, are all reflected in the layout of airport runways. 

A simple, beautiful, and powerful map.
