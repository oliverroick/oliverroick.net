title: Kelpwatch.org extends to South Africa and Namibia
description: New data shows kelp coverage along the costline over the past 40+ years.

[Kelpwatch.org expands to the South Africa and Namibia](https://www.nature.org/en-us/newsroom/kelpwatch-expansion/), showing kelp canopy coverage along coastline over the past 40+ years, derived from continuous Landsat data.

> The maps create a continuous historical record that allows researchers and managers to track long-term patterns of kelp growth, loss, and recovery. “Mapping the canopy-forming kelp forests of southern Africa is an exciting opportunity to better understand how environmental conditions influence these vital systems,” says WHOI’s Dr. Henry Houskeeper, a lead scientist for the project. “Testing kelp forest responses to changing water clarity, upwelling intensity, and ocean circulation across the region will provide valuable insights into how kelp forests respond to shifting conditions.”

I only played a small role in this project so far, processing the data for the expansion.
