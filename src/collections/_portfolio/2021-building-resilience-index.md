With climate-change, natural disasters increase in intensity and frequency disproportionately affecting people in the global south. The Building Resilience Index provides developers, property managers and insurers with a platform to assess building resilience against environmental threads.

We've used open data on natural disasters to identify threads to a building site and generate dynamic vulnarability assessment forms based on likely threads at the site location to assess the property's resilience to those threads.
