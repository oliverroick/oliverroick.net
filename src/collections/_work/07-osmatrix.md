OSMatrix was a tool for visual exploration of OpenStreetMap mapping progress and quality metrics. Using a hexagonal grid, it showed aggregated information, including user contributions, edit dates, and availability of certain feature types. The project has since been discontinued and succeeded by OpenStreetMap History eXplorer, also developed at Heidelberg University.
