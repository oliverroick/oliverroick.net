The [Citizen Cyberscience Summit](http://cybersciencesummit.org/), bringing together an interdisciplinary group of researchers, hackers and citizens to discuss and share ideas on all things citizen science, will be held in London next week from 20th to 22nd February.

Together with [Patrick Rickles](https://twitter.com/mapperpat) I will be giving a talk presenting [past, present and future developments of Community Maps](http://lanyrd.com/2014/citizen-cyberscience-summit/sctzcm/) followed by a short workshop to discuss and share ideas about the next generation of participatory mapping platforms. 

The presentation and workshop will take place on Friday, 21st February, 2p.m. in room 217 in the Chatwick Building.
